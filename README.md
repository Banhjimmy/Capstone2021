The recent increase in wildfires globally has highlighted its effects in producing environmental pollution, loss of property, crops, resources, animals, and people. To address this issue our design team was able to contribute to our clientâ€™s ongoing effort to monitor wildfires using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We were to design a wireless communication system that uses Software Defined Radio (SDR) to transmit aerial data such as images, GPS location and information about the environment surrounding the fire from a drone to a base station. The data from the SDR receiver would be processed at the ground station through an interface with a personal computer to display images of the fire in real time. This project is a collaboration with the Computer Science team who were to produce the classification, object detection and segmentation algorithms for assessing and locating the fire.
